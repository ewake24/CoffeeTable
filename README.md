*DataTable structure in Java*

This library provides a data structure class (DataTable) similar to that of the DataTable in C# and implementing vector operations and functionality similar to that of the R data.frame.  Additionally, the library provides the tools to easily create new DataTables from various types of delimited files as well as to write DataTables to file. 

By nature, a DataTableâ€™s columns are type safe, while its rows allow wildcard adds. However, a special class, MissingValue (similar to C# DBNull), will replace empty fields or NA fields, allow for easy arithmetic functions while avoiding NullPointerExceptions, and otherwise stay out of the way of your operations.
